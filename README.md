### Introduction:

Trash or garbage is the material discarded by humans, Usually due to lack of utility. In urban areas, Garbage of different kinds is collected and treated as municipal solid waste. Various disposal methods are used to treat the garbage collected, Based on the nature of the waste. Improper disposal/non-disposal of garbage leads to pollution in many ways, Which in turn affects the quality of human life.

### What is my app about:

To dispose of garbage properly various effective methods are used based on the type/nature of the waste material. Segregation of garbage at source and collecting it in separate bins helps us to implement the proper disposal methods without much effort. Recyclable waste can be differentiated from non-recyclable waste by the help of this application, thereby helping the environment by not mixing up recyclable and non-recyclable waste. This app also helps us to choose a proper method of disposal for the items scammed, which helps in using the recyclable products effectively. The extent of pollution caused by the object/waste scanned is also displayed to the user, Which urges him to take care of the environment.

### Problems I considered in society:

Air and water pollution caused by the waste disposed of in the surroundings without proper awareness to the people.
Hazardous/toxic waste getting mixed with the household waste without knowledge results in deterioration of the quality of human life due to diseases evolved from the waste.
Plastic that is not recycled and getting mixed with the organic waste which is disposed of on land or water, Poses threat to animal life on land and other flora and fauna.




### Uses of the App:

This app when used effectively, Helps to reduce pollution caused due to improper methods of disposal.
Any waste material scanned can be identified in terms of the substantial composition and the level of pollution it causes, Hence acting as a great tool for you to be a decision maker in disposing of the garbage.

### Conclusion:

Land and  water bodies are subject to extreme contamination due to humans. Most of the contamination is caused by the lack of knowledge to people on the type of garbage disposed improperly and the respective negative effects of it on the environment. This app is an initiative to bring awareness of the same in humans and build the mindset of the people to serve and preserve the environment in a much better way.
